            He would spend a lot of his mid-sems and end-sems ‚Äúprep‚Äù time
            pondering over new project ideas. Of course, to make them open
            source.
            <br />
            During early college summers, he favoured Google Summer of Code over
            other coding competitions. Working on a project that is used by
            thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people is more inspiring
            to him than competing with his friends on Kaggle, let‚Äôs say.
            <br />
            He would get upset if he had to write code which won‚Äôt end up in
            Open Source e.g. when creating an app with his college senior. ‚ÄúWhat
            a waste of collective engineering resource in the world‚Äù, he would
            say.

            He would never ride the hype and fame of Sports Programming i.e.
            spending 12 hours on one problem, writing undocumented C++ that he
            would not be able to understand one month later, let alone any other
            human being.
            <br />
            He would build relationships with a lot of people with similar
            interests. ‚ÄúWe are all in this together‚Äù, he would think. He would
            constantly share his learnings, instead of adding them as a +1 to
            his own personal stack, that he‚Äôd unveil at competitions and
            interviews.
            <br />
            He would spend a loooot of time on thinking if his piece of code
            looks beautiful and is pleasant to read - even at the cost of 10 ms
            extra compile time. <br />

            <br />
            He knew all of this was a dream. That it was soon to be over.
            Because the real world cares more whether you can traverse a tree
            from upside down, downside up, sideways - something he will most
            probably never do in coming 30-40 years of a career, not once.
            <br />
            All these years, he wishes - ‚ÄòIf only someone could pay me to do
            open source full time.‚Äù

            Bird company - its Open Source Program Office (abbreviated as OSPO).
            We will talk more about OSPOs in a bit.
            <br />
            He created Software that would help other teams and engineers in the
            Bird company to produce and consume more Open Source. Few years
            later, all his internship projects would become Open Source in
            itself, for other companies‚Äô OSPOs to use them.

            ex-employees. Some would say, it was a pile of garbage, but not him.

            More workforce without having to hire everyone (Only few companies
            can afford to hire 50 engineers to work on a single project in a
            single team. (Probably none of them). They hire maybe 10 at max (if
            the project gets large) and receive 1000s of contributions from

            Giving back to the community. It‚Äôs a bizzare thing to say, X does

            More and more OSPOs are spawning everywhere. Companies are realizing
            the strategic importance of open source. Not only one cannot escape
            it, but they will have to do it right to stay on top of things. Not
            every OSPO is like Google or Microsoft, but it's good to stay on the
            path.
